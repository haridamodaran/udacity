This package can be used to create a database of players and matches, and to support a Swiss-style tournament.

Players are ranked according to the number of wins, and in case of ties, by the strength of the opponents they've faced. (Each player row in the Player table has a count of the number of wins by their opponents.) An additional function (testStandingsFurther) was added to the end of the tournament_test.py file in order to test this extra functionality. The name of the "reportMatch" function was changed to "registerMatch". 

INSTRUCTIONS:

To create database/tables:
	1. Start psql from the directory containing tournament.sql
	2. Once inside psql, issue the command: \i tournament.sql

To test the functions in tournament.py:
	1. From the command line, issue the command: python tournament_test.py
			-  This will initiate a set of functions to register and remove player, report matches, and report players' standings.
